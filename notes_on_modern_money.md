# The Nature of Money
* Types of Money: Cash and Bank Deposits 

## Bank Deposits 
* Balance Sheets: Assets and Liabilities
* Bank as Intermidiary of Credit and Money Creation -> The convenience of a common unit of account 
* Clearing Housing for Netting
* The need for a reserve asset to settle interbank payments: bank reserves today, gold in the past. 
* The role of central bank and regulators in money creation: setting reserve interest rates and capital requirements 


## Cash and Central Banking

* Central Banks: a strange balance sheet.

In your life, you come in contact with two forms of money: banknotes and bank deposits. Let's start with the latter.

Every bank has a double-entry ledger, also known as balance sheet: on one side you have liabities, what the bank owns to other , on the other side you have assets, what the bank has property off. For a bank to be solvent, the balance sheet has to balance: liabities - assets = 0

Your bank deposit is an entry in the bank ledger, on the side of liabities: the banks owns you that money. So a bank deposit is the debt of the bank. But what is on the asset side? Debt. 

Different kinds of debt, secure debts such as mortages and unsecured debt such as loans to individuals, corporations and even governments. 


But banks needs something to transact with other banks, so in the end you need a reserve assets that it is used to settle 


Banks do maturity transformation/intermediation of credit. Credit money 


## Central Banks

Let's consider the central bank as simply a convinience: bank reserves are liabilities, and a mixture of gold and government bonds are assets. The loop is that the central bank balance sheet can only continue to increase, because the economy does not want more government bonds. 
 
Interest rates over time are going down because of
* Diminuishing growth
* Wealth inequality: marging utility of money
* Globalization
* Technological deflation 
* Aging population 
* Increase in debt 

Negative rates on debt and eventually on money and cash (CBDC), changes in taxation.
